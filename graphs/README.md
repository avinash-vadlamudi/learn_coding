# Graph Algorithms

## Important Points

* Cycle Detection:- In undirected graphs, either bfs or dfs can be used to detect cycles, but in case of directed graphs only dfs can be used.
* In ford-fulkerson algorithm, bfs is preferred because it reduces the worst case complexity to O(VE^2)
* In list, allocation of memory is non-contiguous, but in case of vector, memory is alloted in contiguous manner.
* Solving Puzzles with only one solution, such as mazes can be solved using dfs
